		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>The performance of machine learning (ML) classification algorithms in an open-ended problem with manual labels is difficult to assess, 
		because errors can exist both in the classification and the data. This poster introduces a new visualization, confusion diamond, that exposes 
		both kinds of errors in the context of analyzing affect in chat logs of scientists studying supernovae. I present key design elements of this 
		visualization, relevant usage scenarios, and findings from six semi-structured interviews and two task deployments on Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>
		<h3>Validation</h3>
		<p>A series of studies were conducted to evaluate the design of the confusion diamond:</p>
		<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/etcgroup/diamond_survey/survey/survey1.php">Survey 1: Validation of a single confusion diamond</a>
		<br>
		<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/etcgroup/diamond_survey/survey/survey2.php">Survey 2: Validation of a canvas of 15 confusion diamonds</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The results from these studies validated the confusion diamond as a promising visual aid for domain experts seeking to use machine learning for data analysis.</p>
