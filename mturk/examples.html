<p>The chart above shows an automatic classifier performing well relative to both historic and current data. The automatic classifier is actually learning on the current data, so it's disagreement with historic data is not an error.</p>

The second one is the ideal case where the classifier performed well against the data, and current agreed with both.

The third case is the least ideal. The historical, auto, and current all disagree. The classifier is inaccurate for the data, and it was also not able to learn the new data. In this instance, the historical data is obsolete.
